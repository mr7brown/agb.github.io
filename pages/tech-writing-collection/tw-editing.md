A few years ago I came across a passage in a book (for the life of me I can't remember the title) that told a story of a man in a market with a sign that read "Fresh Fish Sold Here." What ensues is a good lesson for technical writers and for writers in general.

<div class="post-image-container">
    <img class="post-image" src="images/fish.jpeg" />
</div>

## Writing Concise

Let's deconstruct the sign. If we start with *Fresh* it is easy to see why the word is unnecesary. The man in the market wouldn't be selling fish that isn't fresh, would he? 

So, now we are at "Fish Sold Here."

The same objective reasoning can be applied to the words *Sold* and *Here* as well. *Sold* is unnecesary since the man is behind a stand in a market, and *Here* is unnecesarry, because, where else would the man be selling fish?

In the end, we are left only with the word "Fish." 

This is a simple example of deconstructing a sentence, but it is paramount to being a successful technical writer. Each sentence should come under this level of scrutiny to better serve the readers.

## Why Concision is Needed

As technical writers it is our job to [reduce the cognitive load](https://uxplanet.org/8-ways-to-reduce-cognitive-load-part-1-cc2048d1b157) of our readers. With a growing number of documents being published, it can be daunting parsing through information. If we make are sentences concise, we produce better information.
