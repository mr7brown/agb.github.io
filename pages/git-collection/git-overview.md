In this post we will look at Git, the top version control tool used by tech companies. While many of you may be familiar with Git or have heard of it, the purpose of the Git collection is to provide you with the information and skills required from a tech writing standpoint. Most guides are created with the devloper in mind and contain more information than tech writers will ever use.

## Closing Thoughts

By now, you should have a solid understanding of how Git is used. In the next post, [Getting Started w/ Git](/git-getting-started), we will create a remote repository and begin using it just like developers do. We will also begin creating branches, go over some common interview questions, and discuss some essentials for managing workflow.

1. How and when to delete branches
2. Rolling back commits
3. Becomming a power user
