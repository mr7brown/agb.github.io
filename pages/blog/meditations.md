Earth. It's a small, blue sphere drifting through infinite space and is home to the only known sentient life. Its very essence bewilders even the greatest minds and has led to much speculation surrounding when it was created, how it was created, and if it will survive the test of time. For most of earth's residents, little time is devoted to understanding the cosmos. Instead, we are focused on the 1,440 minutes in a day. 

On May 25th, 2020 a black man by the name of George Floyd was murdered when a white police officer (Derek Chauvin) knelt on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. George begged. George cried out for his mother. George was met with silence, and his life was taken. 

Unfortunately, George Floyd's death is far from an isolated incident, but it became the breaking point for Black America, as well as for the millions of allies in the fight against injustice.

## And the World Marched On

In 2016, in response to protesters at one of many un-hinged rallies, Donald Trump stated "part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long [to kick protesters out] is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore...There used to be consequences. There are none anymore."

Those words cut deep into the fabric of modern-day Americans. If only he knew what his words meant.

Trump is right in one sense - we do not want to hurt each other anymore. We are all given these 1,440 minutes each day to live as individuals and as a collective that is trying to be better. ZERO of those minutes are promised to us, and ZERO of those minutes should be wasted on being cruel. Maybe that makes us snowflakes. But for us, we'd rather play in the snow than de-evolve into Neanderthals hiding in our cave. Or is it a bunker?

Trump is, however, woefully wrong in another sense. There ARE consequences that American citizens, especially black and brown Americans, pay with their physical and socioeconomic livelihoods. If you disagree, I urge you to understand #SayTheirNames

This must end. We cannot stop. Or in other words #NoJustice #NoPeace

## Black Lives Matter


It feels as odd today as it did in 2013 to say #BlackLivesMatter. And I'm sure for 400 years it has felt odd for my ancestors to have to explain how they are equal. Imagine trying to convince people that you are equal and should be treated as equals. It's terrifying, odd, frustrating, exhausting, and embarrassing.

Extending beyond the obvious, it's odd to ask permission from your employer to stand up and protest for equality, civil rights, and due process.

It's odd to ask for a few days off from work, and to leave out that it's because it is more important to protest basic civility than to work.

It's odd to ask permission to take the day off for Juneteenth, an event that has been celebrated by the black community for over fifty years - but most people are only hearing about now. 

It's odd to hear the response all lives matter and be told "did you know that cops kill more white people than black people" as if that statement is a viable response to people fighting against the balance of power. 

It's odd. And I say odd, because I'm conditioned to be positive and to let things go.

But, if we want to discuss facts, then let's talk facts and why #BlackLivesMatter. The hashtag, movement, and sentiment were not born out of ignorance. They were born out of necessity. If we compare two separate groups: White Nationalists and those part of #BlackLivesMatter, we see two stark contrasts: 

1.  The White Nationalists (formerly known as the KKK), were founded as a hate group to lynch and kill black people, and for whatever reason, they still proudly exist today. The Black Lives Matter started in 2013 after yet another murder of an unarmed black person (Trayvon Martin) went without punishment. The difference between the two groups is that one group hates and kills with no provocation. The other group wants the words "liberty and justice for all" to extend to black people.

2. White Nationalists, and those who say "all lives matter" or "blue lives matter" are almost exclusively white people. Compare that to the Black Lives Matter participants who come from all walks of life! Of the two groups, which do you think believes that all lives matter. The one comprised explicitly of one race, or the one that doesn't have an entrance criterion that extends beyond not being racist or bigot?
   * By the way, I'd love to see this same [story](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-man-carries-injured-white-person-to-safety-at-london-protest/story-gfzhIABVlFOQ0RY6YuMSsK.html) at a White Nationalist, or All Lives Matter rally.

So, #BlackLivesMatter is not up for debate. If you disagree, in the words of John Oliver "You can very much fuck off."

## The Pulse

The fight against injustice, racism, and police brutality has taken leaps over the past few weeks, even though the unfortunate catalyst for change was the murder of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless other black men and women.

So, let's look at some of the progress before we go:

* All four officers involved in the murder of George Floyd have been fired and arrested. They are still awaiting prosecution.
* According to the LA Times, San Francisco will be replacing officers with trained, unarmed professionals to respond to noncriminal matters (mental health, homeless, school discipline, and neighborhood disputes).
* A national registry is being established to track problematic officers.
  * Reminder: Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed George Floyd, had 17 prior complaints - and was a part of two other citizen deaths while on-duty.
* New York State repealed 50-A, a bill that prevented police misconduct from being public record; and New York State also made chokeholds (like the one that killed Eric Gardner) illegal.

This is just a snapshot of the progress that has been made but keep fighting. Be uncomfortable. Be upset. Most importantly, #BeKind #BeHuman #BeBetter
