## Overview

In the Deployment phase there are two core activities that you will need to be aware of, along with a few processes for each. One set of activities correlate to general project management principles, but in the context of how projects are run within EENB. The second set of activities are unique to EENB and require the completion of processes using a variety of internal tools.

Below is a brief guide for the project management aspects that you should be aware of, as well as an introduction to the larger processes that will occur in the Deployment phase. It’s also important to note that there is a bit of a blurred line between Deployment and Pre-Deployment tasks - meaning, you may hear both terms used interchangeably.

## General Guidelines

In general, you should:

* Try to be as responsive as possible for any escalations
Equipment deliveries, vendor-related issues
* Constantly track the delivery schedule of your equipment. Since EENB isn’t receiving live-data in regards to EUEE equipment tracking, there is some due diligence required on the DPMs part to understand the FDOB date, the process for installation, and the commissioning process for EENB’s cross-functional (XFN) partners
* Create a Workplace group for your project to be used as a medium for communication throughout the project on small questions, XFN collaboration and project status updates that may need greater visibility than a Task. For example, you should include:
  * Facilities PM
  * EUEE ITFS Tech, Logistics Tech
  * VIO DE
  * Events DE
  * RSE PM
  * Any additional partners with an @fb e-mail that should have visibility on project questions
* Schedule pre-FDOB meeting(s) with EUIT teams to ensure that the equipment delivery is on schedule, address any long lead time items and that they are aware and prepared for any items that need to be provisioned

## Confirming network live date is on schedule

While the Facilities team is the primary driver of the meetings where network live dates will be discussed, and Remote Site Engineering (RSE) actually ensures that this date is met, DPMs still need to be aware of the network live date.

The major reason why is because if the network live date gets pushed back for any reason, that will prohibit the EE and VIO teams from installing and commissioning the equipment that allows Facebook to be a successful, globally operating company.

If there are any risks to the network live date being met, these risks should be fully communicated with the PPM for the project, impacted XFN teams and end users to reset expectations for FDOB if there is any impact to EENB scope deliverables for FDOB.  

## Phone provisioning process

To add telephone numbers to conference rooms, phones must be provisioned (assigned to a room). These provisioned numbers must then be assigned to conference rooms, which is done by entering the numbers into the amenities document (seperate process).

## Amenities document process

In general, you will perform the following steps in the process:

* Receive amenities document ~ 4 weeks prior to the project’s FDOB date from CAFM team - via Tasks
* Cross-check the approved spots and dots with the Amenities document to ensure accurate accounting for all amenities
* Address any discrepancies, or complete the template and assign the Task back to the CAFM POC.

## Deployment Tracker guide

The deployment tracker is an Excel spreadsheet to be used by DPMs while doing their final site walks prior to FDOB. The main purpose of the document is to provide the DPM a single resource where they can verify that all requirements within the OTD scope have been completed, track 3 way match information, track EUEE & VIO install and commissioning progress.

In essence, DPMs are the final check in the process (ensuring that Facebook is ready to occupy the building). If there is something that was missed erroneously by EENB’s cross-functional partners, the tracker can be used to notify  them of items that need to be fixed.

And when all rooms are checked and 100 percent ready, it will also serve as a document to signify to PPMs/Regional Leads that the office is ready for the FDOB.
