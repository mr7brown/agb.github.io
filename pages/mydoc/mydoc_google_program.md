## Overview

To support the roll-out of the Google Assistant Built-in Program, I developed
a graphic to represent the different phases that third-party developers would
need to progress through, as well as the high-level steps within each phase.

To remain compliant with the NDA signed with Google, information regarding the
actual processes for each deliverable have been removed.
