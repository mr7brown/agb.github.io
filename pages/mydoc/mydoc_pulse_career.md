## Pulse Feedback Series: Career Growth

Twice a year Facebook administers a Pulse survey to assess how we feel about
working at Facebook. This past pulse survey revealed five key categories where
our team may be able to improve:
* Career growth
* Organizational development (understanding our individual strengths)
* Employee Recognition
* Work/life balance
* XFN relationships

and this post serves as the first of five weekly posts designed to provide
recommendations for each category.   

The first category is Career growth and is the focus area for this week's post.

## CAREER GROWTH

When we think about career growth and how we can continue to develop our
personal-professional brand, there are a few ways to approach the topic. One way
is to take a look at our current skillset and self-analyze. For example, we can
consider asking:
* What are my strengths?
* What areas can I improve in?
* What are some focus areas on our team that I can help address?

Once you've asked yourself the questions above, check out some of the tools
Facebook offers for career growth (links have been redacted):
* Project Management Toolkit Wiki  A resource that provides high-level
information on project phases and what project managers can look for within
each project phase
* Learning & Development @ FB Wiki  Learning & Development e-learning resource
aimed at helping FB employees to grow in core business areas
* Facebook's Learn Tool Facebook's tool for signing up for instructor-led
courses on a variety of topics

Another way to is to reach out to your managers directly and ask for ways to
reach the next level of your career. Having this open dialogue can help open
conversations about your career aspirations, as well as your interests!
Lastly, don't hesitate to share your knowledge with your teammates, because when
we are able to reach our goals collectively, it will also help us to achieve our
goals individually.
