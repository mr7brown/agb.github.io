## Hello, world!

I'm Ashton Brown - a transplant living in the Silicon Valley -
and I'm an adaptable technical writer who’s passionate about working with
engineers, designers, and business operations to make complex information
accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences; and I developed this
site for two primary reasons:

1. Without getting into too much detail, being a technical writer means that
I need to see emerging trends in the tech industry, and then understand how
the technology actually works. Over the past year, one of the more prominent
trends that I'm seeing is for organizations to use a static site for
documentation management - instead of using a Content Management System (CMS).
So, I figured what better way to understand static sites than to use Jekyll, a
static site generator, to build my own documentation portal?

2. I needed a better way to showcase the projects that I’ve worked on over the
past few years. Put simply, sending a barrage of Google docs and PDFs seemed unprofessional, and sending screenshots of web pages featuring my content felt
lazy. So, I came to the conclusion that I need a web-based portfolio, and Jekyll/GitHub Pages gives me the platform to showcase some of the tech writing projects that I've worked on over the past few years; and as an added bonus,
I'm able to structure my content in a manner that the developer community
is familiar with.
