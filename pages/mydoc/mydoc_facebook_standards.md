## Overview

This page shows a collection of images and examples from the knowledge base
I developed using a combination of Wiki syntax and HTML. Also, to stay compliant
with the NDA signed with Facebook, company sensitive information has been
redacted and replaced with the infamous <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> placeholder text.

## Example knowledge base

The images below are examples from the knowledge base that was created for
the Enterprise Engineering New Builds (EENB) team.

### Example standards landing page

The landing page below was developed using both Wiki syntax and HTML.

 {% include image.html file="kb.png" alt="Example" %}

To maintain global design standards and ensure the correct placement of AV/VC
equipment, the team references the standards portal.

### Example documentation landing page

Below is an example of the documentation portal.

Within the documentation portal are all the processes used by the EENB team.
Additionally, the documentation portal also contains a collection of Graphical
User Interface (GUI) guides.
