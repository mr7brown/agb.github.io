This style guide provides general technical editing guidelines for anyone engaged in technical writing

## Objective

The primary goal of this guide is to provide a consistent approach for documentation. In general, this guide can help you on the decision-making process for editing technical/non-technical documentation.

A secondary goal of this style guide is to provide information that can help improve the overall quality of documentation. When documenting anything it is important to understand that it will be read by someone and while the reader may change, the information and the understanding should not. This guide, along with sound writing practices should help you to achieve that goal.

## Non-goals

The information in this guideline is not meant to be a replacement of some of traditional style-guides that have more detail on grammar, punctuation, and general writing (the resources section has more information on some well respected style guides). Instead, this guideline contains supplementary information that is geared to the editorial side of technical writing.

This guideline also does not need to be read through chronologically. Feel free to jump around or go to a section that you need specific guidance on.

## Closing notes

While this guide has focus on industry standards and how to document information in a professional setting, much of the information presented can also be used as a general guide to writing.
