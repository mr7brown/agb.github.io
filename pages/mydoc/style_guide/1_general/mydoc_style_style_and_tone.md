One of the most important aspects of writing is to ability to communicate an idea and to do it in a way that is familiar to the reader. This means that the writing so clearly illustrate a point and it should also be conversational.

When writing it is easy to forget that the writing needs to be above all else, human. This section provides some guidelines for writing conversationally and how to avoid being too formal or too informal.

## Considering your audience

Understanding your audience and the medium in which you are writing is essential for writing in the appropriate tone. In general, your writing should be in a tone that is conversational and professional. Again, we need to remember that the purpose is for the information to be understood.

A lost art in technical documentation is the human aspect. It is easy to be stiff when writing and write in ways that we would never speak

## General tips

When writing, you should keep the words accessibility and fairness in mind. To ensure that the documentation is both accessible and fair, you should avoid:

* Using jargon or wording that may confuse readers
* Writing long, complicated sentences
* Having a structure that is too parallel (starting each sentence or section the same way)
* Making pop culture references
* sexism, ableism, or anthropomorphic language
* Overuse "please"

## Examples

Not recommended:

This guideline is broken down by key topics that offer you the flexibility to jump around to an area of interest or to a specific area that you may have a question on.

As a general note and maybe the most important aspect of this guide: you should treat this as a guideline and not as set of hard rules. There may be situations where the guidelines need to be overruled or where personal preference or a company rule may be more fitting for the documentation; and that is okay.

## Closing notes

While this guide focuses on industry standards and how to document information in a professional setting, much of the information can also be used as a general guide to writing.
