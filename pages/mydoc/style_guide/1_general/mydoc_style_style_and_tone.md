One of the most important aspects of writing is to ability to communicate an idea and to do it in a way that is familiar to the reader. This means that the writing so clearly illustrate a point and it should also be conversational.

When writing it is easy to forget that the writing needs to be above all else, human. This section provides some guidelines for writing conversationally and how to avoid being too formal or too informal.

## Considering your audience

Understanding your audience and the medium in which you are writing is essential for writing in the appropriate tone. In general, your writing should be in a tone that is conversational and professional. Again, we need to remember that the purpose is for the information to be understood.

A lost art in technical documentation is the human aspect. It is easy to be stiff when writing and write in ways that we would never speak. To avoid this try thinking about the point you're attempting to make. Then try to think of how you would explain your point to a friend or colleague, while keeping in mind that the content still needs to be professional.

## General tips

When writing, you should keep the words accessibility and fairness in mind. To ensure that the documentation is both accessible and fair, you should avoid:

* Using jargon or wording that may confuse readers
* Writing long, complicated sentences
* Having a structure that is too parallel (starting each sentence or section the same way)
* Making pop culture references
* Sexism, ableism, or anthropomorphic language
* Overusing "please"
