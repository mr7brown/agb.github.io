When writing content that is inclusive, we need to be sure we are not using language that can be perceived negative by others. One of the most common ways this happens is when we use ableist or sexist language. 

## Avoiding ableist language

Ableist language can be defined as figures of speech that can intentionally or unitentially offend someone. Some examples of ableist language are: crazy, insane, dumb, cripple, blind. Below are some examples of ableist sentences and ways to improve the sentence.

## Avoiding sexist language

Avoiding sexist language is something that has received a lot of attention ofver the past few years and for good reason. There are parts of speech and phrases that has crept into our everyday speaking and writing patterns, but if we want to create inclusive content, then we should avoid sexist language. 

In general we should avoid:

* Using pronouns that exclusively refer to a gender, when the information is genderless.
* Using gender driven words or phrases.

## Avoiding conflict

When documenting a product or feature we commonly see products described in a way that puts down their competition. That is not a good practice. When documenting a feature or project we should try to be objective. Doing so helps to promote sound business practices and helps show that you do not need to harm other companies and their products for yours to stand out.
