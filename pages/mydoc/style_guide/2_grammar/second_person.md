In technical writing it is important for it to be clear who is performing an action. For this reason, documents are typically written in the second person "you" rather than the first person "I/we." This may not always be the case, but regardless if the content is written in second person or first person, your reader should be clear who or what is perfoming an action.

<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: green;"></i> **Recommended:** To begin, you need an SSH key...<br><br>

For the example above, assume that instructions for getting an SSH key are to come.
