Different users willl have different needs. To avoid excessive documentation or documentation that is not detailed enough, it's often useful to provide internal or external links.

## Link formatting

Links should be meaningful and accessible.<br>

<i class="fa fa-thumbs-down fa-lg" style="color: red;"></i> **Not recommended:** Click [here](/accessibility).<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: green;"></i> **Recommended:** For more information about accessibility, see [Accessibility](/accessibility).

Another important note is that the wording of the cross-reference or link matters. When inserting a cross reference contains additional information, use *about* instead of *on*.

<i class="fa fa-thumbs-down fa-lg" style="color: red;"></i> **Not recommended:** For more information on style and tone, see [Style and Tone](/style).<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: green;"></i> **Recommended:** For more information about style and tone, see [Style and Tone](/style).

## Linking to pages in the same directory

To make documentation easier to read, try referencing the page from the root level, for example `/accessibility` instead of using the URL in the browser. This helps keep the code concise and easy to read.

## External links

For external links, you should consider insterting an external link icon: <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>.
