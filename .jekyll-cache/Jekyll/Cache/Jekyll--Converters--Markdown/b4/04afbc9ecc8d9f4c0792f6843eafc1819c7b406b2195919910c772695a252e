<p>There are two primary reasons I created a technology-based blog. First, if you are a self-taught Engineer or Technical Writer like myself, then you know how difficult it can be to find the correct information and best practices. Often times there is simply too much information that it is difficult to begin learning and ultimately creating. My hope is that I can use some of my experiences at Google, Facebook, and HBO to provide industry knowledge of the highest caliber.</p>

<p>Second, the software development and technical writing industries are booming. And neither require the traditional barriers to entry (four-year degree). Instead, the industry is predicated on knowledge and demonstrated ability.</p>

<p>My hope is that providing industry-knowledge and skills in <code class="highlighter-rouge">byte</code> size chunks will help others to improve their skills or get started in tech.</p>

<p>If there are any topics that you are curious to learn more about or you believe would be worth documenting, feel free to reach out to me directly and I will try to curate information that better serves the tech community.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to check out my <a href="/style_intro.html">style guide</a> that I helped write for Google Engineers!</p>
