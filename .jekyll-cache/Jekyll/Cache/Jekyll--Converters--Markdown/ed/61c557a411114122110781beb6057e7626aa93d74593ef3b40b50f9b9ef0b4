<p>This post is the second of five posts in our Pulse Feedback Series, and this
week’s topic is Leveraging Strengths. Similar to last week’s post, there are
multiple ways to approach the topic, but in order to align with one of
Facebook’s overarching goals (driving impact) we will start with two key
methods:</p>

<h3 id="method-1-its-facebook-lets-wiki">Method 1: It’s Facebook, let’s Wiki!</h3>

<p>As with most things at Facebook, there’s probably a Wiki for it. The Learning &amp;
Development Center provides an excellent resource that’s designed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uncover our strengths</li>
  <li>Understand practical applications for our strengths</li>
  <li>Help us to use our strengths to find meaning in our work</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method-2-leveraging-11s">Method 2: Leveraging 1:1s</h3>

<p>One way to uncover hidden strengths is to have discussions regarding individual
passion projects. To uncover these passions, we can try having thematic 1:1s
that extend beyond the “how are you doing today” questions.</p>

<h3 id="example-case-study">Example case study</h3>

<p>Below is an excerpt from a case study concerning a modern approach to 1:1s, an
approach geared towards having more impactful interactions.</p>

<p>Anand Sanwal, the CEO and founder of CB Insights, a company that provides
predictive intelligence on the health of private companies, admits that he
wasn’t always good at running 1:1 meetings with his team members. He states,
“I used to open with a generic, ‘How’s it going?’ But often the answers were
terse and not very substantive.”</p>

<p>What Anand realized was that he needed to get more out of these 1:1 meetings —
both for his sake and the sake of his six direct reports. So now before each
one-on-one, Anand inserts a series of questions into the meeting calendar
invites.</p>

<p>For context, some of the questions that Anand asked were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who do you admire in the organization and why?</li>
  <li>What is the biggest opportunity we’re missing out on?</li>
  <li>What don’t you like about our product (service)?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions helped create the kind of dialogue that can reveal hidden passions or strengths. And if it doesn’t, that’s fine too! It’s simply the desire to spark engaging conversations that makes a world of difference – according to Anand.</p>

<h3 id="a-look-ahead">A look ahead</h3>

<p>Next week we will focus on the third impact area: recognition, and how an
internal Facebook tool can go a long way in helping with employee recognition!</p>
