<p>Unlike other forms of writing, technical writing is better with less variation. For example, when describing the terminal, you should refer to it the same way throughout a document and throughout the whole library of information.</p>

<p>With technical information, it is easy to cause confusion just by referring to a program, applications, or process in a different way. Being consistent helps reduce the mental load thatâ€™s put on users.

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p><i class="fa fa-thumbs-down fa-lg" style="color: red;"></i> <strong>Not recommended:</strong> The filename should match the title record. If the file name does not match, the submission will be rejected. <br /><br />
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: green;"></i> <strong>Recommended:</strong> The filename should match the title record. If the filename does not match, the submission will be rejected.</p>

<p>In the example above, filename is spelled differently in the two examples. For more on spelling, refer to the <a href="/spelling">Spelling</a> section of this style guide.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><i class="fa fa-thumbs-down fa-lg" style="color: red;"></i> <strong>Not recommended:</strong> Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log --oneline</code> from your terminalâ€¦copy the commit that you want to revert, then type â€˜qâ€™ in the shell to exit.<br /><br />
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: green;"></i> <strong>Recommended:</strong> Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log --oneline</code> from your terminalâ€¦copy the commit that you want to revert, then type â€˜qâ€™ to exit.</p>

<p>In the example above, introducing the user to both terminal and shell in the same set of instructions can trip up a novice user. Itâ€™s best to avoid introducing new terms in the middle of instructions. Staying consistent and using one term is good, but rewriting the sentence to remove a need for two instances of the same word is better.</p>

<p>In addition to consistent terminology, formatting should also be consistent. In general, try to avoid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Having inconsistent font/heading sizes.</li>
  <li>Increasing or decreasing the amount of white space between sections unless there is a good reason.</li>
</ul>
