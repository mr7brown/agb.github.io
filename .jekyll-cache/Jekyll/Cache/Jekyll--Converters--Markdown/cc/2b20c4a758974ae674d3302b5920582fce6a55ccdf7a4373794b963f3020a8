I"_<p>A few years ago I came across a passage in a book (for the life of me I can’t remember the title) that told a story of a man in a market with a sign that read “Fresh Fish Sold Here.” What ensues is a good lesson for technical writers and for writers in general.</p>

<p>Let’s deconstruct the sign. If we start with <em>Fresh</em> it is easy to see why the word is unnecesary. The man in the market wouldn’t be selling fish that isn’t fresh, would he?</p>

<p>So, now we are at “Fish Sold Here.”</p>

<p>The same objective reasoning can be applied to the words <em>Sold</em> and <em>Here</em> as well. <em>Sold</em> is unnecesary since the man is behind a stand in a market, and <em>Here</em> is unnecesarry, because, where else would the man be selling fish?</p>

<p>In the end, we are left only with the word “Fish.”</p>

<p>This is a simple example of deconstructing a sentence, but it is paramount to being a successful technical writer. Each sentence should come under this level of scrutiny to better serve the readers.</p>

<p>As technical writers it is our job to reduce the cognitive load of our readers. With a growing number of documents being published, it can be daunting parsing through information.
