I"U<p>A few years ago I made it to the final round of interviews with Amazon’s infamous Lab126 for a Senior Technical Writer position for Alexa Auto. During the interview it became clear that the requsite technical knowledge was something that I lacked, and in one of the interviews I was introduced to an interesting way to think about the differences between technical writers. Essentially there are three types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Writer first, technolgy second.</li>
  <li>Technology first, writer second.</li>
  <li>Middle of the pack at both.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of the three, the one that excels is the writer first. The reason I believe this is because if you do not have a technical background, but you learn the technologies that you will be documenting and can provide crisp examples, you will have an advantage due to writing ability. In other words, you MUST learn the tech.</p>

<p>This section is based on my personal experience at high-tech companies and from looking at the current job market for Technical Writers.</p>

<h3 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h3>

<p>In my personal experience, having an online portfolio that is easy to access is critical to standing out. I’ve been told on numerous final round interviews that having a personal portfolio helped propel me.</p>

<p>Employers almost always require writing samples for technical writers, and want to know how much of the writing was done by the candidate. Having a profile readily available allows employers to see if you meet their criteria right away. Plus, if you combine good and varied writing samples, with the technical ability to code the portfolio (not a must) you raise the bar.</p>

<h3 id="unix-and-git">Unix and Git</h3>

<p>At a basic level, if you are working with docs as code, you will likely be required to make commits through a versioning tool like Git. And to make these commits you need to understand how to work with the terminal.</p>

<p>That said, if we think back to setting the bar, then technical writers need to understand where the bar is at and how to extend beyond it. It is not enough to understand how Unix Git work on a functional level. To stand out, you should build proficiencies to a level similar to engineers. While that may sound daunting, from experience I can tell you that if you know and can exhibit the following, you will find yourself in the higher tier of technical writers:</p>

<h4 id="git">Git</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Be able to clone remote repositories, establish a remote connection, and push commits.</li>
  <li>Understand branching, as well as efficiencies (i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout -b &lt;branch name&gt;</code>) and be able to resolve merge conflicts.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate good commit messages.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="linux-unix">Linux Unix</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Install and configure Linux distribution.</li>
  <li>Move, create, edit, and delete files throught the command line.</li>
  <li>Understand and be proficient with piping, chaining commands, and changing the standard output.</li>
  <li>Be knowledgeable in creating aliases and automations.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have documented all that you need to know for <a href="/tech-blog.html#git-collection-coming-soon">Git</a> and <a href="/tech-blog.html#linux-collection">Unix/Linux</a> for the purposes of Technical Writing. This doesn’t mean that there isn’t more to learn, but the content is more than enough to help you become a power user.</p>

<h3 id="html--css--markdown--object-oriented-language">HTML | CSS | Markdown | Object Oriented Language</h3>

<p>Nearly everything is web-based these days, so it goes without saying that many companies are looking for technical writers who understerstand how web-based applications work. Additionally, in the past technical documentation was written in either plain text or XML. But modern companies have drastically shifted to Markdown. In fact, Google, Amazon, Apple, HBO, Facebook, and many other companies write docs exclusively in Markdown and HTML. So having expert level efficiency in Markdown is important.</p>

<p>As for HTML and CSS, you should be able to produce your own code with no help (aside from Google).</p>

<p>Lastly, you need to understand at least one Object Oriented Language (OO). You do not need to be able to produce it, but you will likely come across Javascript or Python code and need to understand what it does from the syntax.</p>

<p>The examples in this post are not all that you need to know, but this post is assuming that you already have the basic technical writing skills. In future posts I will expand on the writing part of the role in short, target posts.</p>
