I"€<p>There has been a lot of information in this collection, but I wanted to be sure to provide a one-stop resource for Git. The final post in the collection is not as lengthy, and mainly contains some shortcuts and best practices that Iâ€™ve uncovered over the years.</p>

<h2 id="git-shortcuts">Git Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m not going to try to provide a large list of Git shortcuts, since there are a million out ther. But here are some of the quick hits that I use daily:</p>

<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>

<p>The last section of the collection is best practices. This list is subjective and ccertainly not exhaustive, but again, this is what I have discovered and find to work well:</p>

<ol>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading through the Git collection! Hopefully it helped answer some questions surrounding Git and gave you with the foundational skills to help you practice Git, build/host a Git profile, and understand how Git is actually used in the tech writing world.</p>

<p>Be sure to check back soon for new collections and individual posts.</p>
