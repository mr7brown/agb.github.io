<p>The Bank and all of its employees are required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Policy (BSA/AML). To ensure compliance with the USA
Patriot Act and BSA/AML, the Bank has implemented Know Your Customer procedures
and a Customer Identification Program.</p>

<h3 id="section-10">Section 1.0</h3>

<p>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires the Bank to assist U.S. government agencies
in detecting and preventing money laundering. Money laundering refers to
financial transactions in which criminals attempt to disguise the proceeds,
sources, or nature of illegal activities. Various types of money laundering
sustain criminal activities such as drug trafficking, political corruption,
organized crime, and terrorism.</p>

<p>The Bank’s Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Policy (BSA/AML) requires that
all employees conduct business in accordance with BSA/AML laws and regulations.
In conjunction with the USA Patriot Act, the Bank has implemented Know Your
Customer procedures and a Customer Identification Program to address money
laundering.</p>

<h3 id="section-11">Section 1.1</h3>

<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is a critical element of Bank’s BSA/AML. KYC ensures
the Bank takes reasonable risk-based measures to know its customers’ true
identities and understand the nature of its customers’ ownership and sources of
funds, as well as the intended uses of the Bank’s products and services. KYC
processes continue throughout the life of a customer relationship and include
both periodic and compliance-triggered reviews identified in the BSA/AML. This
ensures that customer information remains current and that customers continue to
be accurately risk rated per the policy requirements.</p>

<p>The Bank’s KYC process identifies customers that may pose a money laundering
risk. Per the Bank’s Prohibited Customer Policy, the list of Strictly Prohibited customers includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customers prohibited by Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/Sanctions or included on the Bank’s Watch List as maintained by Compliance.</li>
  <li>Anonymous accounts or customers seeking to maintain an account in an obviously fictitious name.</li>
  <li>Legal entities whose shares are held in bearer share form or that are
authorized to issue bearer shares in the future (see the Prohibited Customer
Policy for a permitted exception).</li>
  <li>Shell banks.</li>
  <li>Unlicensed banks, broker-dealers and money services businesses.</li>
  <li>Foreign financial institutions subject to Section 311 designations.</li>
  <li>Unlawful Internet gaming companies.</li>
  <li>Businesses directly involved in the growth, manufacturing or distribution of marijuana for
any purpose, otherwise defined as marijuana-related businesses.
Customers who are generally prohibited because of a high inherent risk for money laundering activities as defined in the BSA/AML include:</li>
  <li>Third party payment processors.</li>
  <li>Check cashers.</li>
  <li>Embassies, Consulates, Diplomatic Missions and all other legal entities
created for diplomatic or consular purposes.</li>
  <li>Moneytransmitters.</li>
  <li>Money service businesses that conduct foreign currency exchange.</li>
  <li>Businesses that allow for their customers to transact payments using payable
through accounts.</li>
  <li>Prepaid access processors.</li>
  <li>Foreign banks operating under offshore banking licenses.</li>
  <li>Issuers of money orders and travelers checks (excluding the U.S. Postal
Service).</li>
  <li>Businesses that are ancillary to the growth, manufacturing or distribution of marijuana for any purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="section-12">Section 1.2</h3>

<p>The Bank’s Customer Identification Program (CIP) incorporates reasonable
procedures for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Verifying the identity of any person that opens an account.</li>
  <li>Maintaining records of the information used to verify the customer’s identity.</li>
  <li>Providing adequate notice to customers that the Bank is requesting information
to verify identity.</li>
  <li>Determining whether the customer appears on any lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the Bank by any government
agency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="section-13">Section 1.3</h3>

<p>A core element of the BSA/AML is the identification of unusual or suspicious
activity (“red flags”) when an account is opened or at any time thereafter.
Employees must immediately refer any suspicious activity per the requirements of
the BSA/AML. Examples of suspicious activity within commercial lending include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A customer’s stated purpose for a loan does not make economic sense.</li>
  <li>A customer proposes that cash collateral be provided for a loan while refusing
to disclose the loan’s purpose.</li>
  <li>A loan request is for an offshore company or secured by obligations of
offshore banks.</li>
  <li>Loan proceeds are unexpectedly channeled off-shore.</li>
  <li>A customer suddenly pays down a large problem loan with no reasonable
explanation of
the funding source.</li>
  <li>A customer purchases certificates of deposit and uses them as loan collateral.</li>
</ul>
