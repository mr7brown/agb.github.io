I"	<p>Over the past few years technology has boomed and the general technical aptitude of companies has improved. With this increase in technical aptitude, the traditional ways of creating documentation are also shifting. In this post we will look at the traditional way of documentation by using a Content Management System (CMS) and a more modern approach, which takes advantage of some of the great developer tools out there.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with the good. A CMS like SharePoint or Dropbox provide a a place to store documents in a manner that nearly all professionals are familiar with. They are also great solutions for companies or teams with a small set of documentation, especially if the documents are template based.</p>

<p>However, this reality is rapidly fading. Everything has become digitial and with the Covid-19 forcing many of us to work remotely, documentation is already seeing rapid increases. For traditional Content Management Systems, here is the problem. When document sets become large, they become difficult and tedious to maintain. Let’s take a look at an actual example that I came across and solved at HBO.</p>

<p>At HBO we maintain a specification library of around 50 documents that provide content producers with a set of technical requirements that must be met before the content is ingested into the media pipeline.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write docs offline in Microsoft Word.</li>
  <li>Collaborate via e-mail.</li>
  <li>Gain approvals.</li>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>Here you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on over the past few years. For each example in my portfolio I was the sole author, but the majority of the docs required a coordinated effort to draft, <code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">merge</code>, and publish. Similar to the flow below.</p>
