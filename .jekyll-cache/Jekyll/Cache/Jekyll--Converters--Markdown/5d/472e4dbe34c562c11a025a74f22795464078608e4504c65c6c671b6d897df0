<h2 id="inverted-pyramid">Inverted pyramid</h2>

<p>What is the inverted pyramid? The term is often used in content writing and is meant to describe how information should be organized and presented. Essentially it means that at the top (base of the pyramid) of your content should be the most important information. The rest of the content working from top to bottom should still provide useful information, but it should be supplementary.</p>

<p>For example, if youâ€™re explaining how to deploy a Jekyll-powered site, then your content may be presented something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Installing Jekyll, Git, and requisite packages.</li>
  <li>Creating a vanilla Jekyll repo.</li>
  <li>Working with Git.</li>
  <li>Committing changes.</li>
  <li>Running local Jekyll instance.</li>
  <li>Creating Github Pages site.</li>
  <li>Deploying Jekyll Site with Github Pages.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the structure above, it walks the user through a logical progression from obtaining the required tools and programs to deploying a vanilla site to Github Pages. Using the inverted pyramid you can create content that begins with the most important information first and then narrow it down until deployment.</p>

<p>If you neglect this style, it can create a negative user experience. Reason being, if the information doesnâ€™t flow sequentially, users will be forced to jump back and forth between pages and could result in them making errors or choosing a different service altogether.</p>

<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>

<p>Sticking with the theme of presenting information logically and in the inverted pyramid, navigation can often follow similar rules. For example, in this style guide you will notice that within each heading there are subsections that are listed in alphabetical order. Having sections in this way is logical for most users, helps to improve the user experience.</p>

<p>Not all navigation will be able to follow an alphabetical order, but where possible, try to create logical structure.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-ux">A note on UX</h2>

<p>This style guide discusses <a href="/cross-references">links and cross-references</a> and how they should be meaningful. The same can be said for the overall user experience and the navigation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place links in places where users would expect to find them.
    <ul>
      <li>Home button in the top left of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Header</code>.</li>
      <li>Contact button, and extra site navigation on the top right of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Header</code>.</li>
      <li>Links to social sites and copyright in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Footer</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use descriptive names for sidebar and header navigation.</li>
</ul>
