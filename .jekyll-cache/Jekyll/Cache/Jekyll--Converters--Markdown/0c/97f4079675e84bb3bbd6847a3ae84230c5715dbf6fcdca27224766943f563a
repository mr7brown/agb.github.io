<p>Twice a year Facebook sends out a Pulse survey to give employees a chance to
express how they feel about working for the company. This past pulse survey
revealed five key categories where our team may be able to improve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Career growth</li>
  <li>Organizational development (understanding our individual strengths)</li>
  <li>Employee Recognition</li>
  <li>Work/life balance</li>
  <li>XFN relationships</li>
</ul>

<p>and this post serves as the first of five weekly posts designed to provide
quick tips for each category.</p>

<p>The first category is career growth and is the focus area for this weekâ€™s post.</p>

<h2 id="career-growth">Career growth</h2>

<p>When we think about career growth and how we can continue to develop our
personal-professional brand, there are a few ways to approach the topic. One way
is to take a look at our current skillset and self-analyze. For example, we can
consider asking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are my strengths?</li>
  <li>What areas can I improve in?</li>
  <li>What are some focus areas on our team that I can help address?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once youâ€™ve asked yourself the questions above, check out some of the tools
Facebook offers for career growth <strong>(links have been removed)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project Management Toolkit Wiki:</strong>  A resource that provides high-level
information on project phases and what project managers can look for within
each project phase.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning &amp; Development @ FB Wiki:</strong> An e-learning resource aimed at helping FB
employees to grow in core business areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to is to reach out to your manager directly and ask for ways to
reach the next level of your career. Having an open dialogue can create more opportunities for
career growth.</p>

<p>Lastly, we should try to share knowledge with our teammates. Because when we are able to reach our goals as a team, we are also able to reach our goals as individuals.</p>
