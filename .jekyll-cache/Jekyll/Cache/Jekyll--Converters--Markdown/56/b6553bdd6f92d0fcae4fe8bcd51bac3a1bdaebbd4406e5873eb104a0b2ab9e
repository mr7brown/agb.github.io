I"!<p>I’ll start this post by being blunt, but don’t worry, there is light throughout the post…Technical writing and the engineering world isn’t easy.</p>

<p>There is a reason why technical writers at large companies are paid comprable to engineers (depending on level and org.). One is brick. One is mortar, and together they get to work on some pretty cool projects.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-as-a-technical-writer">Getting Started as a Technical Writer</h2>

<p>One of the most asked questions by junior/aspiring technical writers is how to get started, and the answer is that it depends. Unlike other fields where there is a set knowledge base that you need before the offers begin flooding in, technical writing is different. One way to explain this came from a friend of mine who now works at Twitter.</p>

<p>There are technical writers who come from true technical backgrounds. Be it engineering, web development, or something else. Other technical writers may come from academic backgrounds. Each has a particular strength, but the vocation requires a blend of the two.</p>

<p>Employers understand this as well. Sometimes it is good to have a technical writer from a non technical background. They may look outside of the box for solutions that may directly come to the writer with a technical background. And vice versa.</p>

<p>This is all to say, your background may not matter as much as you think it does, and that leads us to what does matter.</p>

<h3 id="1-self-starter">1. Self Starter</h3>

<p>In every position that I’ve held, and many of my collegues (past and present) agree, there has been an abundance of unknowns. One thing that is known is that to be a technical writer you must be self-reliant.</p>

<p>For example, it is likely that you will have a boss that sits on a seemingly different team than you. Which means, you have to understand the important information, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and most useful places to devote your time.</p>

<p>You also need to be okay with the realization that everyone you work with will have exponentionally more information on what you are documenting or working on. That’s why they are SMEs, and you will be left to piece things together.</p>

<p>The sooner that you recognize that being a generalist allows you to be more effective, the more fun the position becomes. Trust me!</p>

<h3 id="2-gaining-experience">2. Gaining Experience</h3>

<p>The question of how to gain experience is a major reason for me creating this blog. There simply isn’t a lot of information out there on the technical writing vocation, and I hope this blog helps in that regard.</p>

<p>Referring back to being a self starter, I believe that is what helped put me in positions to succeed in my vocation. Being a self starter led to me taking on a number of responsibilities that the office struggled to maintain when I took a day off. But, like everyone, I wanted to enjoy a vacation day with my phone completely off. You know, without worrying about work piling up or about my absence impacting the company negatively.</p>

<p>That’s when it clicked. Document the processes that I developed. Automate certain aspects of the process and before you know it, I was placed on a travel team to set up/impleted technology in new facilities across the nation. All it took was being a self starter and looking for avenues for improvement that not only would lead to a quality of life improvement for myslef, but also made life for my peers easier.</p>

<p>In summation, gaining experience is not that difficult, but each situation is unique, just like each technical writer is unique.</p>

<p>Let’s go over two scenarios for gaining experience (there are infinfinite scenarious, so keep that in mind, while you find yours).</p>

<h4 id="currently-employed---officecorporate-job">Currently Employed - Office/Corporate Job</h4>

<p>Of the examples, this is the simplest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with past experience - think of everything or anything that you have documented. Try reproducing that documentation, or creating documentation for the processes that you know extremely well.
    <ul>
      <li>Be careful. If you have examples of bad documentation, that will hurt you more than having no documentation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Being in a corporate position, there are numerous opportunities to create documentation. Look for processes that don’t have documentation or look for errors in existing documentation. Do this can help you build a portfolio, plus it becomes training at the same time (and you are getting paid to do it).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="currently-employed---non-corporate">Currently Employed - Non-corporate</h3>

<p>Same scenarios apply. Look for ways to document, especially if there is an interface. It doesn’t matter if it is a Point-of-Sale (POS) system. There are still prcoesses that need to be followed. Being meticulous in detail about one process does more for you than any certification.</p>

<p>A good example of this is something called the <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/norman-doors-dont-know-whether-push-pull-blame-design/">Norman Door</a>. We have all encountered them, and while it is a banal example, it speaks to the reason why designers and technical writers exist. It is our job to fix, validate and, improve. Those opportunitites are everywhere.</p>

<p>You just need to find them, understand them, diversify them, and then showcase them.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Documenting open source projects is one of the most common answers for gaining experience, and while it can be helpful, it is hard to even get a project to work on (since so many people randomly apply to each project). So, for that reason, I typically advise people to apply to the projects, but to also treat it as the least viable option.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it’s far better to be curious about the world, and help find solutions for problems. That’s what being a technical writer is all about. Solving problems…one manual at a time.</p>
