I"T<p>It’s 2020, much of the world has been in lockdown for the better part of four months, and the United States is burning. How do we get here?</p>

<p>I believe that can be answered with one word: eductation, or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Growing up in Western New York and spending a few of my formative adult years in Buffalo, New York I realized just how important education is, and why our money should be going to education/educators, and not to localized militias.</p>

<h2 id="buffalo-new-york-a-case-study">Buffalo New York: A Case Study</h2>

<p>In 2009 I was a senior in High School, and the most populus city in New York State outside of New York City, Buffalo, had an <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2017/02/10/buffalos-graduate-rate-gains-underscore-statewide-trend/">average graduation rate</a> of just over 50%. I never thought much about the numbers because I received full-ride scholarships to play basketball in college. And sadly, like many people in Western New York, I simply didn’t know what I didn’t know.</p>

<p>The graphic below highlights the reality of when a city of 250,000 residents has a police force that is scheduled to receive $134 million in funding in 2020, while public schooling faces a <a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/buffalo-public-schools-face-nearly-90-million-deficit">$90 million defecit</a> in funding.</p>

<p>For perspective, here are the graduation rate for each city in the graphic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kenmore: 82%</li>
  <li>Cheektowaga: 90%</li>
  <li>Lackawana: 70%</li>
  <li>West Seneca: 92%</li>
  <li>Tonawanda: 90%</li>
  <li>Depew: 90%</li>
  <li>Lancaster: 87%</li>
  <li>North Tonawanda: 84%</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare those numbers to Buffalo ~50% (now around 64%), and it is not difficult to understand the crime rate in Buffalo.</p>

<h3 id="buffalos-education-and-the-economic-impact">Buffalo’s Education and the Economic Impact</h3>

<p>In February of 2017 I moved back to Buffalo to accept a position as a Senior Technical Writer at M&amp;T Bank. It was my first Senior Tech Writing gig and I thought the job would be everything I ever wanted. In one way, it met my expecatations. I finally had full command over my day-to-day, and I was doing work that I believe mattered.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the position also became my inspiration to understand the afore mentioned statistics and the topic for my MBA dissertation.</p>

<p>After a few weeks at M&amp;T I realized that I had to search for black and brown people and simply put, I felt uneasy. That uneasiness became the catalyst for me understanding Buffalo’s demographics better. What I found was comparable to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/buffalocitynewyork">current census </a>, which shows that there is almost a 1:1 relationship between blacks and whites in the city (NYS census treats Buffalo and surrounding areas as a whole).</p>

<p>As I began to dig deeper I realized that the schooling districts with higher graduation rates, and school funding were comprised of primarily white students. Those same students went on to get the high paying jobs and the black and brown people were left behind.</p>

<p>And while we could take this as an isolated incident, similar numbers can be found across the country. Cities with less education have more opportunity and less crime. A prime example of this is what has happened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dqHEx5GIj4">Niagara Falls</a> (15 minutes from Buffalo). Niagra Falls creates a natural border between the United States and Canada. Canada invested in the local community and made it attractive, thus creating opportunity and driving the value up. While America gave little attention to the community and now you can go down nearly any street in Niagara Falls and find 1/3 of houses boarded up and abandoned.</p>

<p>Lack of education, lack of investment in community, and lack of opportunity has left an entire region with a populuous that views graduating high school as a success story and not as the norm.</p>

<p>This may seem like a dynamic shift in topic, but bare with me. Below are two maps that illustrate the need for socioeconomic reform.</p>
