I"<p>The purpose of this post is to highlight why documentation management is important and how we can achieve effective documentation by creating logical information architecture.</p>

<p>We can start by understanding the Inverted Pyramid.</p>

<p>Unlike other documentation where the goal is to get readers to stay on the page for as long as possible, technical docmentation follows a different flow. For example, how many times have you clicked on a headline to read a specific portion of the article, only to find a tiny blurb near the end of the article?</p>

<p>If you’re like me, this happens often and it’s pretty annoying. It is especially annoying in technical or informative reading materials.</p>

<p>This is why technical authors should use the inverted pyramid.</p>
