<div class="alert new-note" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> <b>Important:</b> This page is not reflective of an actual document sent to partners. Rather it is an overview of the release notes, and the site (which I built) that the release notes are for.</div>

<p>The release notes are designed to aid partners who use HBO’s Partner Hub to review content delivery specifications. The release notes are now sent in  an automated message, similar to the format on this page.</p>

<p>In addition to the automated message, HBO partners are also directed to a static page on the HBO Partner Hub, which details release notes from all past releases. This is an important feature due to the fast pace of the industr and the regular updates to HBO’s delivery specifications.</p>
