I"<p>Earth. It‚Äôs a small, blue sphere drifting through infinite space, carrying the only sentient life. It‚Äôs very essence bewilders even the greatest minds, and has led to much speculation surrounding when it was created, how it was created, and if it will last the test of time. For most of earth‚Äôs residents, little time is devoted to understanding the cosmos. Instead, we are focused on the 1,440 minutes in a day.</p>

<p>On May 25th, 2020 a black man by the name of George Floyd was murdered when a white police officer (Derek Chauvin) knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. George begged. George cried out for his mother. George was met with silence, and his life was taken.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, George Floyd‚Äôs death is far from an isolated incident, but it was definitely the breaking point for Black America, as well as for the millions of allies in the fight against injustice.</p>

<h2 id="and-the-world-marched-on">And the World Marched On</h2>

<p>In 2016, in response to protesters at one of many un-hinged rallies, Donald Trump stated ‚ÄúPart of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long [to kick them out] is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore‚Ä¶There used to be consequences. There are none anymore.‚Äù</p>

<p>Those words cut deep into the fabric of modern day Americans. If only he knew what his words meant.</p>

<p>Trump is right in one sense - we do not want to hurt each other anymore. We are all given these 1,440 minutes each day to live as individuals and as a collective that is trying to be better. ZERO of those minutes are promised to us, and ZERO of those minutes should be wasted on being cruel. Maybe that makes us snowflakes. But for us, we‚Äôd rather play in the snow than de-evolve to being neanderthals hiding in our cave. Or is it a bunker?</p>

<p>Trump is, however, woefully wrong in another sense. There ARE consequences that American citizens, especially black and brown Americans, pay with their physical and socioeconomic livlihoods.</p>

<p>This must end. We cannot stop. Or in other words #NoJustice #NoPeace</p>

<h2 id="black-lives-matter">Black Lives Matter</h2>

<p>Moving to the final topic, which also happens to be the underlying message for the entire post, #BlackLivesMatter. This hashtag and sentiment was not born out of ignorance. It was born out of necessity. If we compare two seperate groups: White Nationalists and those part of Black Lives Matter, we see a two stark contrasts.</p>

<p>One: White Nationalists aka KKK, were founded as a hate group to lynch and kill black people, and for whatever reason, they still proudly exist today. The Black Lives Matter started in 2013 after yet another murder of an unarmed black person (Trayvon Martin) went without punishment. The difference between the two groups is that one hates and kills with no provocation. The other, wants the words ‚Äúliberty and justice for all‚Äù to extend to black people.</p>

<p>Second: White Nationalists, and those who say ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù or ‚Äúblue lives matter‚Äù are almost exclusively white people. Versus, the Black Lives Matter participants come from all walks of life! Of the two groups, which do you think belives that all lives matter. The one comprised explicitely of one race, or the one that doesn‚Äôt have an entrance criteria that extends beyond not being racist.</p>

<p>So, Black Lives Matter is not up for debate. If you disagree, in the words of John Oliver: ‚ÄúYou can very much fuck off.‚Äù</p>

<p>The fight against injustice, racism, and police brutality has taken leaps over the past few weeks, even though the unfortunate catalyst for change was the murder of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless other black men and women.</p>

<p>So, let‚Äôs look at some of the progress before we go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All four officers involved in the murder of George Floyd have been fired and arrested. They are still awaiting prosecution.</li>
  <li>According to the LA Times, San Franciso will be replacing officers with trained, unarmed professionals to respond to noncriminal matters (mental health, homeless, school discipline, and neighborhood disputes).</li>
  <li>A national registery is being established to track problematic officers.
    <ul>
      <li>Reminder: Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed George Floyd, had 17 prior complaints - and was a part of two other citizen deaths while on-duty.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New York State repealed 50-A, a bill that prevented police miscounduct from being public record; and New York State also made chokeholds (like the one that killed Eric Gardner) illegal.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a snapshot of the progress that has been made, but keep fighting. Be uncomfortable. Be upset. Most importantly, #BeKind #BeHuman #BeBetter</p>
