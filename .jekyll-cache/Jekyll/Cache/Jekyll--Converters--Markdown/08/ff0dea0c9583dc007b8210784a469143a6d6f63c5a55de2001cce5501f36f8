<p>The example below is an overly verbose sentence that is strictly for illustrating the differences in America and British spelling.
<br /><br />
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-down fa-lg" style="color: red;"></i> <strong>Not recommended:</strong> Organising your folders by colour can help provide visual cues for data structures. It can also help you to manoeuvre through your desktop more efficiently. <br /><br />
<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up fa-lg" style="color: green;"></i> <strong>Recommended:</strong> Organizing your folders by color can help provide visual cues for data structures. It can also help you to maneuver through your desktop more efficiently.</p>

<p>While it is necessary to default to American spelling, that does not mean that you should not look for ways to rewrite a sentence, or reword a piece of information. If there is a chance for confusion, try to avoid the word.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instead of analyze, use examine.</li>
  <li>Instead of authorize, use approve.</li>
  <li>Instead of organize, use structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that it may not be possible to change the word or phrasing in all situations and thatâ€™s okay.</p>
