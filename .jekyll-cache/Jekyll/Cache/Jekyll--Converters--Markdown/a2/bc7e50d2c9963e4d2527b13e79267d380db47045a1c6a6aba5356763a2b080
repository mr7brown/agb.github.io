I"å<p>Iâ€™ll start this post by being blunt, but donâ€™t worry, there is sunshine at the endâ€¦Technical writing and the engineering world isnâ€™t easy.</p>

<p>There is a reason why technical writers at large companies are paid comprable to engineers (depending on level and org.). One is brick; one is mortar. Together they get to create some pretty cool things.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-as-a-technical-writer">Getting Started as a Technical Writer</h2>

<p>One of the most asked questions by junior/aspiring technical writers is how to get started, and the answer is that it depends. Unlike other fields where there is a set knowledge base that you need before the offers begin flooding in, technical writing is different. One way to explain this came from a friend of mine who now works at Twitter.</p>

<p>There are technical writers who come from true technical backgrounds. Be it engineering, web development, or something else. Other technical writers may come from academic backgrounds. Each has a particular strength, but the vocation requires a blend of the two.</p>

<p>Employers understand this as well. Sometimes it is good to have a technical writer from a non technical background. They may look outside of the box for solutions that may directly come to the writer with a technical background. And vice versa.</p>

<p>This is all to say, your backgrround may not matter as much as you think it does. And that leads us to what does matter.</p>

<p>In every position that Iâ€™ve held, and many of my collegues (past and present) agree, that the position comes with a lot of unknown and a lot of self-reliance. For example, it is likely that you will have a boss that sits on a seemingly different team than you. Which means, you have to understand the important information, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and most useful places to devote your time.</p>

<p>You also, will live in a perpetual state of the imposter-syndrome.</p>

<p>Everyone you work with will have exponentionally more information on what you are documenting or working on, and that is why they are SMEs.</p>

<p>The sooner that you recognize this, the more fun the position becomes. Trust me!</p>
