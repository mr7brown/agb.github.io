<div class="alert new-note" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> <b>Important:</b> This page is not reflective of an actual document sent to partners. Rather it is an overview of the release notes, and the site (which I built) that the release notes are for.</div>

<p>The release notes are categorized by type and by page, as applicable, on the HBO Max Partner Hub. The classifications are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>

<p>When HBOâ€™s Platform Architecture team needs to schedule maintenance for the site, the release note contains a <strong>MAINTENANCE</strong> tag that provides a date and timeframe for the downtime.</p>

<h2 id="feature">Feature</h2>

<p>Within the <strong>FEATURE</strong> tag, there are a few subcategories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New site pages added to the Partner Hub</li>
  <li>New site features, such as UI/UX additions, button additions for better UX, etc</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>FEATURE</strong> tag is typically linked with a page on the site, and a link to the specific feature is provided within the release note.</p>

<h2 id="fixed">Fixed</h2>

<p>The <strong>FIXED</strong> tag applies to all bug fixes, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typos</li>
  <li>Faulty code</li>
  <li>Enhanced code</li>
</ul>
