<p>Twice a year Facebook sends out a Pulse survey to give employees a chance to
express how they feel about working for the company. This past pulse survey
revealed five key categories where our team may be able to improve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Career growth</li>
  <li>Organizational development (understanding our individual strengths)</li>
  <li>Employee Recognition</li>
  <li>Work/life balance</li>
  <li>XFN relationships</li>
</ul>
