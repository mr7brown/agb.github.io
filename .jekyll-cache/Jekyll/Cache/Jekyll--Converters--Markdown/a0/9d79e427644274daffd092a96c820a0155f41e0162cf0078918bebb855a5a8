<p>In the Deployment phase there are two core activities that you will need to be
aware of, along with a few processes for each. Below is a brief guide for the project management components, as well as an introduction to the larger processes that need to be completed in the Deployment phase.</p>

<h2 id="general-guidelines">General guidelines</h2>

<p>In general, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Try to be as responsive as possible for any escalations.</li>
  <li>Constantly track the delivery schedule of equipment. Since EENB is not
receiving live EUEE equipment tracking, there is some due diligence required to
understand the FDOB date, the process for installation, and the commissioning
process for EENBâ€™s cross-functional (XFN) partners.</li>
  <li>Create a Workplace group that can be used as a medium for communication
throughout the project on small questions, XFN collaboration, and project status
updates. Add the following XFNs to the Workplace group:
    <ul>
      <li>Facilities PM</li>
      <li>EUEE ITFS Tech, Logistics Tech</li>
      <li>VIO DE</li>
      <li>Events DE</li>
      <li>RSE PM</li>
      <li>Any additional partners with an @fb email that should have visibility on
 project questions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Schedule pre-FDOB meeting(s) with EUIT teams to ensure that the equipment
delivery is on schedule.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="confirming-network-live-date-is-on-schedule">Confirming network live date is on schedule</h2>

<p>While the Facilities team is the primary driver of the meetings where network
live dates will be discussed, and Remote Site Engineering (RSE) actually ensures
that this date is met, DPMs still need to be aware of the network live date.</p>

<p>For example, if the network live date gets pushed back for any reason, that will
prohibit the EE and VIO teams from installing and commissioning the equipment
that allows Facebook to be a successful, globally operating company.</p>

<p>If there are any risks to the network live date being met, these risks should be
fully communicated with the PPM for the project. DPMs should also communicate
risks to any cross-functional partners that may be impacted by a delayed
network live date.</p>

<h2 id="phone-provisioning-process">Phone provisioning process</h2>

<p>To add telephone numbers to conference rooms, phones must be provisioned
(assigned to a room). These provisioned numbers must then be assigned to
conference rooms, which is done by entering the numbers into the amenities
 document.</p>

<p><strong>(Link to separate process has been redacted.)</strong></p>

<h2 id="amenities-document-process">Amenities document process</h2>

<p>In general, you will perform the following steps in the process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Receive amenities document ~4 weeks prior to the projectâ€™s FDOB date from
CAFM team - via Tasks.</li>
  <li>Cross-check the approved spots and dots with the Amenities document to ensure
accurate accounting for all amenities.</li>
  <li>Address any discrepancies, or complete the template and assign the Task back
to the CAFM POC.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="deployment-tracker-guide">Deployment Tracker guide</h2>

<p>The deployment tracker is an Excel spreadsheet to be used by DPMs while doing
their final site walks. The main purpose of the document is to provide the DPM
with a single resource to verify that all construction and commissioning
requirements for the build have been met.</p>

<p>In essence, DPMs are the final check in the process. The tracker can be used
to document the final checks and as a medium for updates, as applicable.</p>
